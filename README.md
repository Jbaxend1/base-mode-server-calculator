# Base Mode Calculator

## Description

Duration: 2 weeks

Create a server based calculator with a user interface that contains two number input fields and opperator buttons that allow for submission of basic equations. Then display the answer along with a history of past equations on the DOM. 

This was accomplished by creating the UI that then pushes the input equation to node server via POST and then returns the equation's answer and variables via a GET. All of the logic for the equations is done within the server.
